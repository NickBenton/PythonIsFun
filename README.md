# PYTHON IS FUN!


The point of this project is to help you understand how commiting code would work in an 
actual work environment as well as to receive feedback on coding projects by way of code 
review.

# That Sounds Amazing!! Tell Me How I Can Do It!
 First I think you should undestand what Git is and what a pull request is.

# My Bad... What's Git!?
If you're reading this, you already are on "Git". 
 - **Git** is the most commonly used version control system today. 
 - **GitHub** is a free repository for Git projects. The most widely used by far.
 - **Version Control (VC)** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over 
time so that you can recall specific versions later.
 -- The most common use for VC within a company beyond tracking is for collaboration. So that 
everyone can maintain the same set of code.

# I think I get it (I lied) Now where does a Pull Request (PR) fit in?
Each of you have been given a branch to work off of. We will be using what is called Trunk 
Based Development. If you want to get an in-depth understanding of what Trunk Based 
Development is and it's value, feel free to explore https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/ but 
I'll go over the cliff notes here.

I have created a "Trunk" (think tree) for each of you. They are named 'NameDevelop' this is 
the industry standard for the branch used during development. In a 2 trunk system you have 
**Master** and **Develop**. In this case **Master** is where I'll include things I think will 
be necessary to send to you, imagine your 'NameDevelop' branch is your personal **Master** 
branch.

Each time that you make a change to your 'NameDevelop' branch, you will create what is known 
as a **Feature Branch** for naming convention, we'll name them each 
**INITIALS-Feature-ShortDescription** I.E. _NB-Feature-Lab1_. Once you've gotten to a point 
where you think you've finished said feature, you'll request to merge the code into your 
'NameDevelop' branch. We'll go step by step through a hypothetical soon.

This **Pull Request** will allow a reviewer to ensure that all changes done are 
intentionally. It also allows the reviewer to do a **Code Review** where they can leave 
comments and give teaching points (I'm important!).

I'll add more here as you ask.
